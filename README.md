# Continuee Mobile

Continuee will allow you to share links between your registered devices leveraging Firebase platform.

## Why?

For fun, and to learn Flutter! 

I think there should be an easier way to share links among your own devices other than sending them through a messaging application, or relaying on the history features (i.e. YouTube).

## When?

I am trying to get a working prototype completed by January 2022. You should take a look at the [server app](https://github.com/mariomenjr/continuee-server), it's made with Typescript.

## How?

Docker, Typescript, Flutter, and some time of my weekends! (you also may join if you like!).
